- Use python3
- Ensure a virtual environment is set up with correct python version
-- it's installed in .venv
-- to enter virtual env run `source .venv/bin/activate`
- use pip to make sure requirements are installed in environment
- use flask and websockets (socketio seems to be the preferred tool)

- Set up connection between Android app and server
- Build out status data
- eventually build out control from app to GA and SC
